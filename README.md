# Tower of Hanoi

The Tower of Hanoi is a classic puzzle game where the objective is to move all disks from one peg to another, following specific rules. This project implements the Tower of Hanoi solution with a graphical user interface (GUI) and an animated disk movement in C++.


## Description

The Tower of Hanoi puzzle involves three pegs and a number of disks of different sizes. The puzzle starts with all disks stacked on one peg, ordered from smallest (top) to largest (bottom). The goal is to move the entire stack to another peg, following these rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. A disk can only be moved to the top of a larger disk or an empty peg.
3. The puzzle must be solved using the minimum number of moves.

This project provides a visual solution to the puzzle, demonstrating how the disks move from one peg to another using recursion.
